# Hangman Game

This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python where you have to guess the name of an animal.

## How to Play

1. The computer randomly selects a word (name of an animal) from its word bank.
2. You have a limited number of guesses (6 in this case) to correctly guess the word.
3. Every time you make an incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends either when you guess the word correctly or when you run out of guesses.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `hangman.py` file.

3. Run the game:
   ```
   python hangman.py
   ```

## Gameplay

- The hangman will be displayed progressively as you make incorrect guesses.
- You need to input single letters as guesses.
- If the letter you guessed is in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).
- If you guess the word correctly within the allowed number of guesses, you win!
- If you use up all your guesses without guessing the word correctly, you lose.

## Customize

- You can customize the word bank in the `hangman.py` file by adding or removing words (animals) in the `words` list.
